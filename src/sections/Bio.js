        <span>We are Test The Waters, a pop punk band from the Bay Area. Our music is energetic, fast-paced, and above all fun.</span>

          Test The Waters consists of TJ Tamura on vocals/bass guitar, Devon Martin on lead guitar, Cole Twitchell on rhythm guitar, and Ryan Bouquet on drums. In 2014 we all met in our freshman year
          dorms at Cal Poly SLO. The die of fate rolled a nat 20, as TJ, Devon, and Cole were all roommates. After paying the ultimate blood price, Ryan was inducted into the circle of roommates as
          well. The bond of friendship remained throughout college and lingered after graduation when TJ left for a two year teaching gig in Japan.

          And then, a message from across the Pacific, heralded by angels and carried on wings of an eagle. TJ wanted to create a pop punk band and, like Jesus to the virgin Mary, Test the Waters was
          born. Our initial demos were written by sending song files back and forth until we were eventually able to close the distance and record together.
